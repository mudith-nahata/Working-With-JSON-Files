# Manipulation of JSON Files Using Pandas
To read the files, we use read_json() function and through it, we pass the path to the JSON file we want to read. Once we do that, it returns a “DataFrame”( A table of rows and columns) that stores data. If we want to read a file that is located on remote servers then we pass the link to its location instead of a local path.

-->This is a text format that is often used to exchange data on the web.
